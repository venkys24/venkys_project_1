## 1. MAC Address Changer
A MAC Address Changer allows users to modify the MAC address of their device.

### **Benefits**
- **Privacy & Anonymity:** Prevents tracking by ISPs, advertisers, and hackers.
- **Enhanced Security:** Helps bypass blacklisting and prevents MAC-based attacks.
- **Testing & Development:** Useful for testing network configurations.

### **Usage**
```bash
python3 mac.py -i eth0 -m 00:11:22:33:44:55
```
- `eth0` = Preferred interface for changing MAC
- `00:11:22:33:44:55` = New MAC address

---

## 2. ARP Spoofer
An ARP Spoofer manipulates the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) to redirect network traffic.

### **Benefits**
- **Ethical Hacking:** Helps test network security vulnerabilities.
- **Packet Sniffing & Traffic Monitoring:** Used for network analysis.
- **Defensive Security Measures:** Helps train employees on ARP spoofing threats.

### **Usage**
```bash
python3 arp1.py -t 192.168.5.133 -g 192.168.5.2
```
- `-t` = Target IP address
- `-g` = Gateway address
